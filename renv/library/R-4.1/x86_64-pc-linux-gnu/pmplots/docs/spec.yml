plots:
  section: Plots generated
  requirements:
    - Functions `dv_time`, `dv_tafd`, and `dv_tad` plot `DV` versus the
      appropriate time measure; both lines and points are plotted
    - Functions `dv_pred` and `dv_ipred` plot `DV` versus the appropriate
      predicted value; a line of identity is added as well as a loess smothing
      line; both the x- and y-axis maybe be transformed to log scale
      with the `loglog` argument; if `loglog` is used, only positive
      values are retained for the plot
    - Functions `res_time`, `res_tafd`, and `res_tad` plots residual
      versus the appropriate time measure; a reference line is added
      at `res=0` as well as a loess smoothing line
    - Functions `wres_time`, `wres_tafd`, and `wres_tad` plots weighted
      residual versus the appropriate time measure; a reference line is added
      at `wres=0` as well as a loess smoothing line
    - Functions `cwres_time`, `cwres_tafd`, and `cwres_tad` plots conditional
      weighted residual versus the appropriate time measure; a reference line is added
      at `cwres=0` as well as a loess smoothing line
    - Functions `res_pred`, `wres_pred` and `cwres_pred` plot the appropriate
      residual versus population model predictions (`PRED`); a horizontal
      reference line is added at `c/w/res=0` as well as a loess smoothing line
    - Functions `res_cont`, `wres_cont`, and `cwres_cont` plot the appropriate
      residual versus a continuous covariate in the data set; a horizontal
      reference line is added at `c/w/res=0` as well as a loess smoothing line
    - Functions `res_cat`, `wres_cat`, and `cwres_cat` makes a boxplot of the
      appropriate residual versus a categorical data set column
    - Function `wres_q` and `cwres_q` generates quantile-quantile plots of the
      appropriate residual value; a refereince identity line is added
    - Function `eta_hist` generates histograms of model ETAs and returns a list
      `gg/ggplot` objects
    - Function `eta_cont` generates a scatterplot of model ETAs versus a continuous
      variable in the data set; a horizontal reference line at `ETAn=0` and
      loess smoothing line are also added to the plot
    - Function `eta_cat` generates boxplot summaries of model ETAs by a
      categorical variable in the data set
    - Function `eta_pairs` generates pairs plots using the `ggpairs` function
      from the `GGally` package
    - Function `splitplot` splits the input data set according to a
      discrete data item and generates a plot according to a user-named
      function, returning a list of `gg/ggplot` objects
cont_cont:
  section: Continuous scatter
  requirements:
    - x-axis options availabe in `x_scale_continuous` can be modified
      by the xs argument
    - y-axis options available in `y_scale_continuous` can be modified
      by the ys argument
    - When loess smoothing lines are generated, `geom_smooth` with
      `ggplot2` default behavior is used; the smooth may be modified
      through the `smooth` argument
    - A title may be added through the `title` argument
cont_cat:
  section: Boxplot summaries
  requirements:
    - x-axis options availabe in `x_scale_discrete` can be modified
      by the xs argument
    - y-axis options available in `y_scale_continuous` can be modified
      by the ys argument
    - Boxplot summaries are generated using `geom_boxplot` with `ggplot2`
      default configuration
    - If `shown` is `TRUE`, a numeric summary of each box is included
      below each box. In the summary, `n` is the number of non-`NA`
      observations in the
      `y` column for that box and `N` is the number of unique `ID` values
      for that box.  An error will be generated if `ID` does
      not exist in the plotting data frame when `shown` is `TRUE`.
      When `N` is equal to `n` in the summary, only `n` is shown.
    - A title may be added thought the `title` argument
input:
  section: Input data
  requirements:
    - Data are input as data.frame or tibble
    - Data sets are expected to be filter prior to plotting, so that
      the input data frame only contains rows that are appropriate
      for the current plotting function
    - For continuous scatter plots, numeric data are required
      or an error is generated; data are considered discrete
      if they are `numeric` or `integer`
    - For boxplot summaries,  discrete
      data are required for x-axis for boxplot summaries; data are
      considered discrete of they are `character`, `factor`, or `logical`
look_feel:
  section: Look and feel
  requirements:
    - Scatter plots are made with black points via `geom_point`
    - Box plots are made with white fill via `geom_boxplot`
    - The `ggplot2` default grid lines are retained on the plot
    - Plots are made with white background
    - Loess lines are blue and dashed
    - Lines of identity and horizontal reference lines for
      scatter plots are solid grey
rpackages:
  section: R packages
  requirements:
    - "Imports: `dplyr` `(>= 0.7.2)`, `rlang` `(>= 0.1.2)`"
    - "Depends: `ggplot2` `(>= 2.2.1)`"
    - "Suggests: `testthat`"
