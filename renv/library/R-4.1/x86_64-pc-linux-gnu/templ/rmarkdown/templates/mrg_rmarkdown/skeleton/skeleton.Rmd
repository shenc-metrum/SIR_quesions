# NOTE

This notebook provides a technical record of results generated from an R script.
Any final version of this script will have been QCâ€™d to ensure the quality of
the underlying R code, but the material has not been organized or curated for
clarity of communication. For an organized and curated summary of these
analyses, MetrumRG recommends a formal communication deliverable such as a full
report, brief communication, or slide deck.
